# Introduction to Cyber Security

## What is Cyber Security?
Cybersecurity involves the protection of systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access.

## Importance of Cyber Security
Securing information and data is crucial to protect individuals, organizations, and nations from cyber threats.

## Cyber Security Domains
- Critical infrastructure security
- Network security
- Endpoint security
- Application security
- Cloud security
- Information security
- Mobile security

## CIA Triad
The CIA Triad represents the core principles of cybersecurity:
- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring data is only accessible to authorized individuals.
- **Integrity:** Maintaining the accuracy and reliability of data.
- **Availability:** Ensuring data and resources are available when needed.

## Vulnerability, Threat, and Risk
- **Vulnerability:** Weaknesses or gaps in security.
- **Threat:** Potential danger or harm to assets.
- **Risk:** Likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

## Common Cybersecurity Threats
- Malware
- Ransomware
- Phishing
- Insider threats
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, etc.

## Key Cybersecurity Technologies and Best Practices
- Security awareness training
- Identity and access management
- Attack surface management
- Threat detection, prevention, and response
- Disaster recovery

## Cyber Kill Chain
A series of stages outlining the steps of a cyber attack, from reconnaissance to achieving objectives.

## Offensive vs Defensive Security
- **Offensive Security:** Ethical hacking and penetration testing.
- **Defensive Security:** Implementing measures to prevent and mitigate cyber threats.
